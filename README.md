# Hectic in Hero Home
This is a game mode for the Overwatch Workshop, and is a variant of the popular Trouble in Terrorist Town.

in Hectic in Hero Home, Players spawn as a basic hero and a timer starts counting up. Found around the map, Players can find orbs in which Heroes will be presented, allowing them to switch heroes by using their interact key, and orbs can be dropped by crouching and pressing the interact key.

Once the timer runs out, each player can see their own 'role' which they play during that round. The key is that they can only see the role of themselves, and not that of others.

There are three roles:
- Innocents: Players who have to work together to survive. Innocents are unable to see who has what role.
- Traitors: Who have betrayed the innocents, and their goal is to take all others down. Traitors can see other Traitors
- Hero: They are a special role available with 5 players and up, who can seek bodies for clues about that player. Everyone can see who the hero is.

Note: For maximum fun, it is recommended to be in a voice chat with the other players, as well as adhere the rule to go quiet when you go down!

## How to play: 
Simply download the text file from the project, and copy its entire content to your clipboard. Open Overwatch, start a custom lobby, and open the settings. You should find a orange button near the top right that lets you import the script into the lobby.
